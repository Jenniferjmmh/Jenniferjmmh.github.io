        Descrption
        Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients. Web developers often are implementing ideas that others may have even those others lack the technical know-how to turn those ideas into an actual, functional website.
